abstract = {Virtually all characteristics of tunas and billfishes reflect their highly charged lifestyles as apex predators in the oceanic pelagic environment. The adaptations they possess for efficient and rapid swimming, efficient and rapid food processing, turnover of nutrients and storage and mobilization of internal fuel supplies, and for rapid recovery rates, are discussed. Overall, tunas, and billfishes are designed for high performance, at both sustainable and burst swimming speeds, but there are several differences between tunas and billfishes. Tunas' aerobic metabolic capacities exceed those of ectothermic fishes, including billfishes and other scombrids, by virtue of their elevated red muscle temperatures, and because heart and white muscle aerobic capacities are significantly greater in tunas. The adaptations for high performance involve some costs, including the need for a constant high energy input to sustain high metabolic rates, high activity levels, and endothermy, Yet, tunas and billfishes have adopted successful lifestyles, as evidence by their large numbers and biomass within the marine environment. Although our knowledge of these fishes has increased dramatically during the past 15 years, there are major gaps in our understanding of the metabolic biochemistry and physiology of these fishes, and these are highlighted so that additional research can be directed towards filling these gaps},

abstract = {Achieving sustainable fisheries and certifications can be challenging for developing countries, affecting the achievement of global seafood sustainability and food security. Indonesia is one of the world's leading producers of tuna products but struggles to achieve certification. Small-scale tuna fisheries are an important component of the Indonesian fisheries sector, especially with regard to employment and income. The Marine Stewardship Council is the most recognised fisheries certification scheme worldwide but is criticised for being inaccessible to small-scale fisheries. Fair Trade has traditionally focussed on land-based products, but recently developed a standard for capture fisheries. Traceability systems are important components of many fisheries certifications and are essential in ensuring product quality and food provenance. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities facing Indonesian small-scale tuna fisheries achieving certification and implementing traceability. The outlook for certification of such fisheries is promising, given recent global and national developments but requires increasing commitment to communicate the importance and value of such schemes in developing countries.},

Target utama alat tangkap ini adalah ikan tuna yang mempunyai nilai ekonomis penting seperti tuna mata besar dan madidihang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui karakteristik kapal dan perubahan metode penangkapan rawai tuna di Indonesia. Pengumpulan data dilakukan oleh pemantau ilmiah (observer) pada kapal rawai tuna yang berbasis di Pelabuhan Benoa Bali, mulai Agustus 2005 hingga November 2014. Pemantau ilmiah mencatat data dan informasi meliputi: panjang tali cabang (PTC), panjang tali pelampung (PTP), panjang antar tali cabang (PATC), jumlah pancing antar pelampung (JPAP), jumlah mata pancing, lama waktu tebar pancing dan lama waktu perendaman. AnalisisAnova satu arah dan tes Tukey dilakukan untuk mengetahui perubahan karakteristik armada rawai tuna selama beberapa tahun. Hasil analisis menunjukkan terjadi perubahan karakteristik operasi rawai tuna selama beberapa tahun (p{\textless}0,05). Jarak antar tali cabang dan panjang tali pelampung berfluktuasi dengan menunjukkan pola yang acak. Jumlah mata pancing dan lama waktu tebar pancing juga berfluktuasi namun cenderung menurun jumlah dan durasinya. Selanjutnya, jumlah pancing antar pelampung juga memiliki kecendurungan lebih sedikit dalam kurun waktu beberapa tahun. Panjang tali cabang dan lama waktu perendaman menunjukkan peningkatan dalam panjang dan durasinya Hasil penelitian ini diharapkan dapat memberikan gambaran yang lebih lengkap terhadap perubahan karakteristik kapal rawai tuna Indonesia di Samudra Hindia.Â Tuna longline is one of the important fishing gears for the fisheries industry in Indonesia. The target species of this type of gear are a group of economically important tuna that have higher economic values such as bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna. This study aims to investigate the fleet characteristics and the modification of fishing method of tuna longline in Indonesia. Data collection was conducted by scientific observers on tuna longline fishing vessels, mainly based in the port of Benoa Bali, from August 2005 to November 2014. The scientific observers record the information that will be tested were: length of branch line (LBL), length of float line (LFL), length between branch line (LBBL), number of hooks between floats (NHBF), number of hooks, length of set time and length of soak time. Analysis of one-way Anova and Tukey tests conducted to determine the changing characteristics of tuna longline fleets in several years. The analysis showed that changes in the characteristics of longline tuna operations for several years (p {\textless}0.05) were likely occurred. Length between branch line and length of float line were fluctuated with random pattern. Number of hooks and length of set time also fluctuated but tended to decrease in number and duration. Furthermore, number of hooks between floats also tends to decrease in recent years. Length of branch line and length of soak time showed an increase in the length and duration. The results of this study are expected to provide a more complete picture of the presence of changes in the characteristics of the Indonesian tuna longline fleets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {â Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are known to preferentially occupy the surface mixed layer above the thermocline and it has been suggested that they are physiologically restricted to water temperatures no more than 8 â¢ C colder than surface waters. However, we here report for dive data acquired from a large yellowfin tuna which demonstrate for the first time that this species is indeed capable of making prolonged dives into deep cold waters. A yellowfin tuna (134 cm fork length) caught near an anchored fish aggregating device (FAD) in the Seychelles (Western Indian Ocean) was equipped with an internally implanted archival tag and released. The fish was recaptured 98 days later. As predicted for this species, this fish spent 85{\%} of its time shallower than 75 m (maximum thermocline depth experienced by the fish) but, over the course of the track, it performed three deep dives to 578 m, 982 m and 1160 m. Minimum ambient water temperatures recorded at these depths were 8.6 â¢ C, 7.4 â¢ C and 5.8 â¢ C respectively and varied by up to 23.3 â¢ C from surface temperatures. The fish spent 8.3{\%} of its time in waters more than 8 â¢ C colder than the surface layer and daily experienced a wide range of sea temperatures (mode at 15â16 â¢ C) and of temperatures of the gut cavity (mode at 6 â¢ C). The reason for these dives can not be known. These depths and temperatures significantly exceed those reported in the literature so far and clearly demonstrate that this species has the physiological and behavioral ability to penetrate deep cold sections of the ocean.},

abstract = {The Indian Ocean Tuna Tagging Program provided a unique opportunity to collect demographic data on the key commercially targeted tropical tuna species in the Indian Ocean. In this paper, we focused on estimating growth rates for one of these species, yellowfin (Thunnus albacares). Whilst most growth studies only draw on one data source, in this study we use a range of data sources: individual growth rates derived from yellowfin that were tagged and recaptured, direct age estimates obtained through otolith readings, and length-frequency data collected from the purse seine fishery between 2000 and 2010. To combine these data sources, we used an integrated Bayesian model that allowed us to account for the process and measurement errors associated with each data set. Our results indicate that the gradual addition of each data type improved the model's parameter estimations. The Bayesian framework was useful, as it allowed us to account for uncertainties associated with age estimates and to provide additional information on some parameters (e.g., asymptotic length). Our results support the existence of a complex growth pattern for Indian Ocean yellowfin, with two distinct growth phases between the immature and mature life stages. Such complex growth patterns, however, require additional information on absolute age of fish and transition rates between growth stanzas. This type of information is not available from the data. We suggest that bioenergetic models may address this current data gap. This modeling approach explicitly considers the allocation of metabolic energy in tuna and may offer a way to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed growth patterns.},

abstract = {Biological parameters such as age, growth and age (or size) at maturity are vital for accurate stock assessments and management plans to ensure that fisheries develop sustainably. Despite this, very few validated age studies have been conducted for large tropical pelagic species within the Australian region. Age and growth parameters were estimated for bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1839), sampled from longline fisheries in the Australian region using validated techniques based on counts of annual increments. Poor increment clarity reduced the number of otoliths included in the final analysis to only 50{\%} of the 3200 selected for reading (39 178-cm fork length). Microincrement analysis confirmed the position of the first two annual increments in these otoliths. A maximum age of 16 years was obtained, but over 80{\%} of fish in the Australian catch were {\textless}5 years old. Growth is most rapid in the first few years of life and asymptotic length is reached at about age 9 to 10 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated at L= 169.09, k = 0.238, and to = 1.706 for the south-west Pacific Ocean and L= 178.41, k = 0.176, and to = 2.500 for the eastern Indian Ocean. These parameters were significantly different, suggesting that there is little mixing between populations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Length at 50{\%} maturity for females sampled in northern Queensland was estimated to be 102.4-cm fork length. },

abstract = {Age estimates, typically determined by counting periodic growth increments in calcified structures of vertebrates, are the basis of population dynamics models used for managing exploited or threatened species. In fisheries research, the use of otolith growth rings as an indicator of fish age has increased considerably in recent decades. However, otolith readings include various sources of uncertainty. Current ageing methods, which converts an average count of rings into age, only provide periodic age estimates in which the range of uncertainty is fully ignored. In this study, we describe a hierarchical model for estimating individual ages from repeated otolith readings. The model was developed within a Bayesian framework to explicitly represent the sources of uncertainty associated with age estimation, to allow for individual variations and to include knowledge on parameters from expertise. The performance of the proposed model was examined through simulations, and then it was coupled to a two-stanza somatic growth model to evaluate the impact of the age estimation method on the age composition of commercial fisheries catches. We illustrate our approach using the saggital otoliths of yellowfin tuna of the Indian Ocean collected through large-scale mark-recapture experiments. The simulation performance suggested that the ageing error model was able to estimate the ageing biases and provide accurate age estimates, regardless of the age of the fish. Coupled with the growth model, this approach appeared suitable for modeling the growth of Indian Ocean yellowfin and is consistent with findings of previous studies. The simulations showed that the choice of the ageing method can strongly affect growth estimates with subsequent implications for age-structured data used as inputs for population models. Finally, our modeling approach revealed particularly useful to reflect uncertainty around age estimates into the process of growth estimation and it can be applied to any study relying on age estimation.},

It shows that 82{\%} of the variance in a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species.

The expected range of 2.5 {\textless} b {\textless} 3.5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two weightâlength relationships per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in weightâlength relationships.

Rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities. Nature 2003;423:280â3). Their analyses were published in a high profile science journal along with an accompanying press release, which then attracted substantial international media focus and public attention. This media focus in turn has been used as a base for advocating major marine policy changes for pelagic tuna fisheries (e.g. a minimum of a 50{\%} reduction in catches and establishment of extensive marine reserves). However, among numerous scientific experts involved in tuna and pelagic fishery research substantial concerns exist that Myers and Worm's analyses provide a misleading picture of the status of large predatory pelagic fishes. These concerns are reviewed using data from the Indian Ocean for illustrative purposes and indicate that the initial longline catches were not responsible for a rapid depletion of the main tuna and billfish stocks nor were they threatening the overall sustainability of these stocks. However, the status of a number of theses stocks is of concern as a result of large increases in catches in more recent years. The debate sparked by Myers and Worm's paper should not distract from the critical problem of developing and implementing effective international management policies. In addition to implications for fishery management, the publication, peer-review, scientific response and publicity process associated with the publication of Myers and Worm's paper are discussed. Concerns are raised that if these become standard practices for articles in high profile science journals that this would undermine the trust placed in such journal to provide an accurate and well-balanced representation of the most important new scientific findings and in their role to inform policy decisions based on these findings.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The weightâlength relation (WLR) is an important tool in fish biology, physiology, ecology, and fisheries assessment and has been originally used to provide information on the condition of fish and determine whether somatic growth is isometric or allometric (Ricker 1975, Oscoz et al. 2005). WLRs are useful in determining weight and biomass when only length measurements are available, as indications of condition and to allow for comparisons of species growth between different regions (Koutrakis and Tsikliras 2003). Bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1839); yel-lowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares (Bonnaterre, 1788); and albacore, Thunnus alalunga (Bonnaterre, 1788), are the important commercial species in the tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans (Driggers et al. 1999, Sun et al. 2001, Miao and Huang 2003, Farley et al. 2006). It constitutes an extremely valuable fishery resource intensively exploit-ed by Asian longliners, and US and European purse sein-ers, at various stages of its life cycle (St{\'{e}}quert and Conand 2000). However, the stocks of the above tuna species, especially bigeye tuna, are almost on the verge of over-exploitation and may soon be regarded as over-fished (Joseph 2003). It is crucial to the future existence of this economically important species that the best pos-sible biological data on the species is provided to fish-eries managers (Manooch and Hinkley 1991). This study contributes to the knowledge of the WLRs of bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna and albacore of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.},

Linear displacement between release and recapture locations ranged from zero (all species) to 15,744 km (mean 575, median 119, SE 44) for blue marlin, 6,523 km (mean 719, median 216, SE 33) for white marlin, and 3,845 km (mean 294, median 98, SE 13) for sailfish. In total, 2,824 (80.0{\%}) billfish were recaptured in the same management area of release. Days at liberty ranged from zero (all species) to 4,591 (mean 619, median 409, SE 24) for blue marlin, 5,488 (mean 692, median 448, SE 22) for white marlin, and 6,568 (mean 404, median 320, SE 11) for sailfish. The proportions (per species) of visits were highest in the Caribbean area for blue marlin and white marlin, and the Florida East Coast area for sailfish. Blue marlin and sailfish were nearly identical when comparing the percent of individuals vs. the number of areas visited. Overall, white marlin visited more areas than either blue marlin or sailfish. Seasonality was evident for all species, with overall results generally reflecting the efforts of the catch and release recreational fishing sector, particularly in the western North Atlantic. This information may be practical in reducing the uncertainties in billfish stock assessments and may offer valuable insight into management consideration of time-area closure regulations to reduce bycatch mortality of Atlantic billfishes.},

abstract = {In the early 1990s, the spawning biomass of the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) population was estimated to be less than 10{\%} of its historical level. However, major uncertainties surrounding the age composition of the catch confounded the virtual population analysis assessment models. To eliminate these uncertainties, validated estimates of the age composition of the catch were required. We examined scales, caudal vertebrae and sagittal otoliths to determine which structure produced the most accurate age estimates in SBT. Scales proved useful for estimating ages of SBT only up to 4 years. Marginal increment analysis verified that the zones of dense circuli visible on the scales were deposited annually up to this age. In larger fish, the compression of circuli on the margin of scales and high incidence of regenerated scales made estimation of age very difficult. Obvious increments were present on both the vertebrae and otoliths. Age estimates from the two structures matched closely for the first 10 years of life. However, in larger (older) fish the counts diverged, otoliths consistently providing higher age estimates. We determined that annual increments are formed on sagittal otoliths throughout life but that this is not the case in vertebrae, where bands are formed less frequently. Thus, vertebrae were unreliable for estimating age beyond 10 years, which corresponds approximately to the age-at-first maturity. Ages were estimated from otoliths of 1121 fish from throughout the species' size range. These data indicate that SBT live to at least 40 years of age, twice the longevity previously accepted; that age at recruitment is 1 year, not 2; and that mean age-at-maturity is approximately 11 years, not 7. The age distribution of SBT catches by the Japanese longline fishery in the Tasman Sea indicate that a significant proportion of the SBT population in this area is over 25 years of age and that cohorts spawned in the late 1970s and early 1980s are markedly under-represented in the population. The latter is thought to result from intense exploitation on these cohorts by the Australian surface fishery soon after recruitment. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Commercial tunas and billfishes (swordfish, marlins and sailfish) provide considerable catches and income in both developed and developing countries. These stocks vary in status from lightly exploited to rebuilding to severely depleted. Previous studies suggested that this variability could result from differences in life-history characteristics and economic incentives, but differences in exploitation histories and management measures also have a strong effect on current stock status. Although the status (biomass and fishing mortality rate) of major tuna and billfish stocks is well documented, the effect of these diverse factors on current stock status and the effect of management measures in rebuilding stocks have not been analysed at the global level. Here, we show that, particularly for tunas, stocks were more depleted if they had high commercial value, were long-lived species, had small pre-fishing biomass and were subject to intense fishing pressure for a long time. In addition, implementing and enforcing total allowable catches (TACs) had the strongest positive influence on rebuilding overfished tuna and billfish stocks. Other control rules such as minimum size regulations or seasonal closures were also important in reducing fishing pressure, but stocks under TAC implementations showed the fastest increase of biomass. Lessons learned from this study can be applied in managing large industrial fisheries around the world. In particular, tuna regional fisheries management organizations should consider the relative effectiveness of management measures observed in this study for rebuilding depleted large pelagic stocks.},

abstract = {The Beverton-Holt length-based mortality estimator has received widespread use primarily due to its applicability in data-limited situations. The mean length of animals that are fully vulnerable to the sampling gear can be used to estimate total mortality from basic growth parameters and a known length at first capture. This method requires equilibrium conditions because the mean length of a population will change only gradually after a change in mortality. In this study, we derive the transitional behavior of the mean length statistic for use in nonequilibrium conditions. We investigate conditions affecting the reliability of the Beverton-Holt results and then develop a new procedure that allows a series of mortality rates to be estimated from mean length data representing nonequilibrium conditions in multiple years. We then examine an assessment of goosefish Lophius americanus that was criticized for its use of the Beverton-Holt estimator under nonequilibrium conditions. Using data from the 1963-2002 National Marine Fisheries Service annual fall groundfish surveys off the northeastern United States and assuming a single change in total mortality, we used the maximum likelihood method to estimate that the total mortality of goosefish in the southern assessment region increased from 0.31 to 0.60 per year in 1977. Estimates of the new mortality rate made three or more years after the change were relatively stable and only ranged from 0.55 to 0.71 per year, while estimates from the standard Beverton-Holt approach ranged from 0.37 to 1.1 per year. The results for goosefish in the northern assessment region showed that total mortality changed from 0.14 to 0.29 per year in 1978 and then to 0.55 per year in 1987. The new nonequilibrium estimator allows a change in mortality to be characterized reliably several years faster than would occur with the use of the Beverton-Holt estimator.},

The cards were developed at the request of the Working Party on Tropical Tunas, the Working Party on Neritic Tunas and the Scientific Committee. The identification cards were produced to help improve catch data and statistics on tuna and tuna-like species, as well as on other species caught by fisheries in the Indian Ocean. The cards will be distributed to the primary intended users: scientific observers under the framework of the IOTC Regional Observer Scheme, however they will also be distributed and used by fishers in order to record and report interactions. Fisheries training institutions and fishing communities are other potential users.},

abstract = {North Atlantic albacore and eastern Atlantic bluefin tunas perform feeding migrations to productive areas of the northeast Atlantic Ocean during the summer. Climate change is likely to influence the timing and even the spatial distribution of albacore and bluefin tunas during this event. Thus, tuna catches during their feeding migration to the Bay of Biscay have been analyzed from 1967 to 2005 for albacore tuna and from 1981 to 2005 for bluefin tuna. The results indicate that tuna arrive now earlier to the Bay of Biscay, with albacore tuna arriving about 8 days earlier than 40 years ago and bluefin tuna arriving 14 days earlier than 25 years ago. This represents a rate of change of 2 and 5.6 days per decade, respec-tively. Besides, albacore tuna mean catch latitude showed an increasing trend over time. Statistical anal-yses provided the first evidence of the North Atlantic regime shift, as well as climate variability, influencing changes in migration phenology and spatial distribution of albacore and bluefin tunas.},

Saat ini, kondisi stok madidihang berada dalam kondisi yang baik. Namun, untuk menjaga kelangsungan pemantaatan stok ikan tuna, diperlukan upaya pengelolaan sumber daya tuna. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui distribusi laju tangkap madidihang di Samudera Hindia Bagian Timur. Pengumpulan data dilakukan oleh pemantau ilmiah pada kapal rawai tuna komersial yang berbasis di Benoa, Pelabuhanratu dan Bungus dari Agustus 2005 sampai Desember 2013; serta program monitoring pendaratan tuna yang berbasis di Benoa tahun 2010-2013. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa laju pancing bervariasi secara bulanan dan tahunan. Rata-rata bulanan laju pancing tertinggi terjadi pada Mei (0,17 ekor/100 pancing) dan terendah pada Februari (0,01 ekor/100 pancing), sedangkan rata-rata laju pancing tahunan tertinggi pada 2006 (0,11 ekor/100 pancing) dan terendah pada 2011 (0,06 ekor/100 pancing). Rata-rata laju pancing tahunan cenderung mengalami penurunan sebesar 29,48{\%}/ tahun. Ikan madidihang tertangkap oleh rawai tuna Indonesia tersebar dari 0Â°-34Â° LS dan 76Â°- 134Â° BT. Sebaran spasial laju pancing tertinggi berada di sekitar Kepulauan Mentawai dan selatan Jawa Timur hingga Nusa Tenggara},

abstract = {The focus of the study is to explore the recent trend of the world tuna fishery with special reference to the Indian Ocean tuna fisheries and its conservation and sustainable management. In the Indian Ocean, tuna catches have increased rapidly from about 179959 t in 1980 to about 832246 t in 1995. They have continued to increase up to 2005; the catch that year was 1201465 t, forming about 26{\%} of the world catch. Since 2006 onwards there has been a decline in the volume of catches and in 2008 the catch was only 913625 t. The Principal species caught in the Indian Ocean are skipjack and yellowfin. Western Indian Ocean contributed 78.2{\%} and eastern Indian Ocean 21.8{\%} of the total tuna production from the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean stock is currently overfished and IOTC has made some recommendations for management regulations aimed at sustaining the tuna stock. Fishing operations can cause ecological impacts of different types: by catches, damage of the habitat, mortalities caused by lost or discarded gear, pollution, generation of marine debris, etc. Periodic reassessment of the tuna potential is also required with adequate inputs from exploratory surveys as well as commercial landings and this may prevent any unsustainable trends in the development of the tuna fishing industry in the Indian Ocean.},

abstract = {This paper presents the estimate of the weight-length relationship for the Thunnus albacares fishery associated with an offshore buoy in the Equatorial Atlantic, as well as the length conversion to access the actual population structure that is being exploited. Data were obtained from May, 2010 to April, 2011 in the landings at the fishing pier of Areia Branca, Northeast Brazil, and on board during a research cruise in February, 2011. We sampled a total of 348 individuals of T. albacares but the estimates of the length conversion equation data were derived from 174 individuals and to the weight x length relationship data from 201 individuals. By linear regression analysis the following conversion formula of pectoral fin-fork length on fork length data was obtained: FL = 6.0522 + 1.2445 PFFL. The relationship between log-length and log-weight data is represented by the regression ln DWT= -10.711+ 2.9347 ln FL, whose potential equation is WT = 0.0000223 x FL 2.935 .

Foram amostrados 348 indiv{\'{i}}duos de T. albacares, sendo utilizados para a estimativa da convers{\~{a}}o de comprimento os dados de 174 indiv{\'{i}}duos e para a estimativa da rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o peso x comprimento os dados de 201 indiv{\'{i}}duos. Atrav{\'{e}}s da an{\'{a}}lise de regress{\~{a}}o linear chegou-se {\`{a}} f{\'{o}}rmula de convers{\~{a}}o de comprimento da nadadeira peitoral a forquilha para comprimento furcal: FL = 6,0522 + 1,2445 PFFL. A rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre os dados log-transformados de comprimento e peso {\'{e}} representada pela regress{\~{a}}o ln WT = -10,711 + 2,9347 ln FL, cuja equa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o potencial {\'{e}} WT = 0,0000223 .
