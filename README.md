## Description
This repository was created as a part of final project assignment on Big Data Analysis course, which will attempt to demonstrate our understanding and expertise on big data analysis gained from the course. 

## About the data
Data stored in data directory here is a factual fisheries landing data recorded in Benoa fishing port, Indonesia in the year 2016. It has more than 60 thousand records which contains several species, mostly billfish and giant-tuna species. It has length measurement record and individual weight records. It also has date records (dates and months), and the type of product when the vessel landed their fish. The usability of the data is restricted and designed specifically for this assignment. You may NOT use this data without permission from the author.

## About the sript.R
The script is just the environment for me to run several codes that I need before I write it to the .Rmd file. You may NOT use this script for replicating the work similar to this work because not all the codes inside this script are used. 

## About the markdown.Rmd
This is the file that you may need to replicate the process. Attention! This file contains a function (**plot_ly()**) that PREVENT you to knit your work into .pdf and word file. This function has an interactive plot that only works on .html file. You MAY NEED to modify or not use the function if you want to export your work to .pdf and word file. 

## Troubleshooting! 
If you still want to use the **plot_ly()** function and create a .pdf file, you may need to:
1. Disable the **plot_ly()** function first, then knit your work to a word document.
2. Enable the **plot_ly()** function, then knit your work to .html file, and take a screenshot of the plot/s. 
3. Insert the screenshot plot/s to your word document.
4. Save as your word document to a .pdf file.

## Note!
Some information on the website suggested updating the **plotly** package will resolve the problem. However, until this work uploaded, there is no difference between before and after updating the package.
